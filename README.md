### The challenge

This is a password generator app that I built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It allows users to generate strong passwords based on their preferences.

### Features

- Generate passwords based on the selected inclusion options: Users can choose to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their passwords.
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard so they can paste it into a website or app.
- See a strength rating for their generated password: Users can see how strong their generated password is by checking the strength rating.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size: The interface will automatically adjust to the size of the user's screen, so it will always be easy to use.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page: All interactive elements on the page will have hover and focus states, so users will know what they are clicking on.

### How to use

- Open the app in your browser.
- Select the inclusion options for your password.
- Click the "Generate Password" button.
- The generated password will be displayed in the text field.
- Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the password to your clipboard.
- Click the "Strength Rating" button to see how strong your password is.
